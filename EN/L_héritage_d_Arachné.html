                <h3>A book that made me feel good</h3>
                <p>Presenting a book? How does it help us in our personal development?
                     Do we read in a mechanical way, I do not think we read because the
                     book interests us, we take a particular interest in it, we take pleasure in it,
                    it does us good and relaxes us. </p>

                    <h3 class="vert"> What does reading do for us</h3>
                    <p>I decided to introduce you to a book that is very close to my heart
                         because I read it during the first confinement and it is thanks 
                         to this book that I started to read novels more and more. 
                         Before I read it I didn't think that reading could bring so
                        much to a person. This book made me feel so many emotions,
                        I enjoyed reading it so much that I didn't want to finish 
                        the book and keep on reading it again and again but in the end
                        I don't regret it. I laughed, cried, was angry or even shocked
                        while reading it. I hope that I will continue to read and 
                        that I will have what I wanted the most, a nice and big 
                        library where I can read and re-read the books I like.</p>

                    <h3 class="vert" >Présentation of the book</h3>
                    <p>This book I'm talking about is called "L'héritage d'Arachnée" 
                        by Marine Kellada. It is a fantasy novel with a love story, 
                        plot twists and a very advanced plot. The story revolves around
                         a young woman who is going to meet a very mysterious man thanks
                          to her father but this meeting is going to generate some 
                          changes in the life of the young woman who finds herself 
                          linked to this man.
                        <em>"Arachos, I promised that I would never leave you again, remember?"</em></p>

                    <h3 class="vert" >What do remember?</h3>
                    <p>I find that reading allows you to cut yourself off from the real
                        world and to lock yourself in your bubble, it is a moment of 
                        detachment from reality. Literature comforts and reassures us
                        thanks to these stories of all kinds. For me it's really like 
                        I change my universe when I read and it makes me feel better
                        when I'm stressed or when I doubt.Even if you are not a reader
                        I advise you to try it if you want to experience strong 
                        moments, emotions or escape from the reality that is yours.</p>

                    <p>"The human being is stupid. He only really realizes the importance of the other when he loses him, when the gaping hole left by the absence is already there, deep and irreparable. We live as if there were always a tomorrow for everyone, but this is false. Yesterday - it's just as well - my mother held me in her arms and I confided my heartaches to her; today she was gone. Today I had only my father left, my one and only family; tomorrow he could be gone, like mom... Death could take him... or me." 

                        "I tried to play down the situation so as not to give in to anxiety: Arachos was a real scientific object, the mystery of the century, the mascot of the Clay'Lab scientists. It was therefore not surprising, almost logical, that he could have "abnormal" abilities [...] The idea was really exciting. The realization of it was terrifying. I looked up in panic at Arachos, and when they took him away, my attachment to him broke. 
                        - No! Leave him! 
                        Inside, my heart also began to break. Slowly, surreptitiously, without my knowledge..." 
                        
                         
                        "I found the spider-man standing on a tree branch. As soon as he saw me, he jumped to the ground and I glanced behind me, which did not escape him. 
                        
                        Do you want to stay here?" he asked, staring at me with his dark, crimson eyes. 
                        
                        They're... They're... They're like the men in white," he stammered. 
                        
                        Not all men are bad, you know. Arachos, I promised I wouldn't leave you again, remember? So stop worrying and take me back to the... to the... uh... to the cabin instead 
                         
                        
                        I hesitated. If I stayed here, I would surely find some good soul to put me up, I would be warm and could probably contact Whitehorse to be picked up. But... there was Arachos... He seemed determined to take care of me, sometimes awkwardly, but his intentions were noble and I couldn't bring myself to leave him... 
                        
                        He nodded his head, smirking."  </p>
